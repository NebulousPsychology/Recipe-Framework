# Recipes

encoding recipes as consistent syntax

## TODO

- a json-to-markdown converter
- A json schema (could be produced by the markdown converter?)
- More sample recipes, to develop the schema and explore the needs of the markdown converter

## Testing

`dotnet test .\src\RecipeFramework.sln -l "console;verbosity=detailed"`
